Example Buffer Overflow Script
Description
This Python script demonstrates a basic example of a buffer overflow. It calculates a required buffer length, creates a payload, and prints it. Note that this script is a simple illustration and can be extended or modified to demonstrate more complex buffer overflow scenarios.
